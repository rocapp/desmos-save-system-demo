# Desmos Graphing Calculator Save System Demo

### Inspired by [DingShizhe's Desktop version](https://github.com/DingShizhe/Desmos-Desktop)

[Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/about) is an advanced graphing calculator implemented as a web application and a mobile application written in JavaScript.
<br /><br />
This version demo is a web application that primarily implements menu bar controls, with functional opening and saving local `.des` files and high-resolution screenshots using the [Desmos API](https://www.desmos.com/api/v1.8/docs/index.html), and shortcuts. It works locally on your browser, no accounts nor saving online nor sharing links. (Desmos API is online... so it's online)
<br /><br />
This demo was created with the intent to save and manipulate created graphs for personal experimentation, since it is not possible with the official version (I think).
<br /><br />
A mobile-friendly GUI is currently not planned :)
